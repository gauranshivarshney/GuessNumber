# GuessNumber
 
This is a simple Number Guessing Game where the player has to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game provides feedback whether the guessed number is too high, too low, or correct. Players have up to 10 attempts to guess the number, after which the game will end, and they can start a new game.

## Features
 - Random Number Generation: The game generates a random number between 1 and 100 at the start of each game.
 - User Input Validation: Players are required to enter a valid number between 1 and 100. If they input anything else, an alert will notify them to try again.
 - Display Previous Guesses: The game displays the player's previous guesses to help them track their progress.
 - Feedback on Guesses: The game informs the player if their guess is lower or higher than the random number. If the player guesses the correct number, a congratulatory message will be displayed.
 - Game Over: After 10 incorrect guesses, the game will end, and a message showing the correct number will be displayed.
 - Start New Game: Once the game ends, players can click a "Start New Game" button to reset the game and try again.

## Technologies Used
 - HTML: For creating the structure of the game.
 - CSS: For styling the layout and appearance of the game.
 - JavaScript: For handling the game logic, including generating random numbers, validating user input, displaying results, and resetting the game.
